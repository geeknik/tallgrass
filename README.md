# Tallgrass

A prairie-inspired privacy overlay network designed for adversarial anonymity.

Tallgrass is a research-grade implementation of an anonymity overlay network that draws inspiration from prairie ecology: data moves like wind through tall grassâ€”diffuse, layered, and untraceable. The system emphasizes metadata resistance against powerful network observers, compromised relays, and traffic analysis adversaries.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`)

### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geeknik/tallgrass.git
cd tallgrass
cargo build --release
```

### Running Simulations

Start a basic anonymity network simulation:

```bash
# Start simulation with 3 relays and 5 clients for 30 seconds
cargo run simulate --relays 3 --clients 5 --duration 30
```

### Manual Testing

**Terminal 1 - Start Relay:**
```bash
cargo run relay --port 12345
```

**Terminal 2 - Connect Client:**
```bash
cargo run client --relay-addr 127.0.0.1:12345 --message "safe communication"
```

## Architecture Overview

### Privacy Features

## Design Principles

Tallgrass is built on security-by-design principles:

- Assume powerful, global passive adversaries
- Assume some relays are compromised
- Minimize metadata leakage and correlation surface
- Research-grade implementation for threat modeling

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for complete technical specifications.
